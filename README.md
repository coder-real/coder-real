Hi, I'm Anthony. 👋 I’m a developer who learns by building. I don't like staying in one lane—I enjoy experimenting with how software interacts with the physical world and secure systems.

Right now, I'm working on combining hardware (IoT) with web apps, and exploring blockchain architecture.

My Toolbox: TypeScript, Dart, & C++.
